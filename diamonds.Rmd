## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot2::diamonds
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=diamonds, aes(x=price)) +
  geom_histogram(fill="steelblue", color="black") +
  ggtitle("Histogram of Price Values")

print(Sys.time())
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
